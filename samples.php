			<h3>Snow Shoveling</h3>
			<p>Once we were shoveling the snow around our house and my husband was his wearing a snow jacket but
			when I saw it, I ask him when was the last time that jacket had been washed? He replied he didn't
			remember and continued shoveling the snow. At that moment I call him "cochino", and as always he
			translated the word literally which means "dirty or nasty" which forced me to explain that in Peru
			"cochine" is just slang for dirty and that I wasn't trying to be rude.</p>

			<h3>Serve Like an Indian</h3>
			<p>My mom used to tell me that we would not over serve our plates or glasses, she would say
			"Don't serve like and Indian". I once told my husband that little fact and now when I serve something to
			him he normally says, "serve me like an Indian".</p>

			<h3>The Lost Squirrel</h3>
			<p>He has the memory of squirrel when needed to do chores, he will always say he has forgotten, but
			I'm no silly Latina. I will call, text message, send him an email, or do what ever is needed to remind
			him his chores.</p>
