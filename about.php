			<h1>About</h1>
			<p class="hr"></p>
					<p>I wrote this book because like my Latina friends and I have encountered similar
					situations being married to people from a different cultures. A family that shares
					two cultures, two languages and two lifestyles is just so rich! You and your husband
					can pick the things you both enjoy from each others cultures, and integrate it all
					into your own unique family culture. This book is based on my life and my experiences
					while being married to one of the best gringos in the world. We have so much in common,
					yet so much different all at the same time.</p>
					<p>Additionally, this book also strives to share the stories, both the highs and lows,
					of a multicultural relationship. Experience are told through the voices of my friends.
					It is hard to start living with someone regardless of your culture, however when cultural
					differences come into play it can make a life even more exciting!</p>
